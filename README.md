Aims to simulate a simple restaurant management system

Completed Features:
- login/homepage transition with popups/tabbed view 
- Manage preset # of tables ordered by table number
- Start and end dining sessions, keep track of time started/ended
- Make orders based upon preset menu
- Change waiters based upon employee list

- Split menu items evenly across customers or move them completely to another bill

Planned Features (TODO):
- implement manage tab (edit menu items, employees)
- implement history tab (view sold items & waiter distribution)
- implement settings tab (basic behavioural settings)
- connect to an embedded database (H2 DBMS)
- remove redundancy from data model
